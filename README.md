Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was designed to be a 24:00 clock that prompts the user to add set the time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
The problem that it solved is keeping time. 

What did you do particularly well?
I kept the code clear and concise and commented the code accordingly.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could enhance the code in using more protected variables. This would increase program security. I could also add more user validation to ensure the program functions logically in all instances. 

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of this code for me was debugging for logical errors. I took time to plan the code out better before moving forward with testing to overcome this. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
User input/output, validation, loops. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this program maintanalbe, readable, and adaptable by following standards in the presentation of the code ofself (proper indentation, braces, etc.) and using comments to describe what each portion of the code was meant to do.
